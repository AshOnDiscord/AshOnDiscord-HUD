# AshOnDiscord HUD
HUD/UI fabric mod for 1.19.3. Will upgrade to 1.19.4/1.20 eventually. Uses https://github.com/0x3C50/Renderer as the rendering library. Forge port not planned and likely will never come.

## Workspace
Don't edit the serverside code(leave empty), unless you have a hud module that benefits from it and doesn't change any serverside behavior + a toggle(in game or just in the code like a boolean).

`./run/` by default only includes the mods dir(which has some basic mods that we should probably have support for aswell are just nice to have while testing). Nothing else should be included.

## (Planned/Complete) Features
- [X] FPS
- [X] Keystrokes
- [X] CPS
- [X] Ping
- [X] Coordinates
- [ ] Server IP
- [ ] Reach(Sorta implemented rn)
- [ ] Current Pack(shows name + icon of your pack)
- [ ] Time(IRL and game)
- [ ] Speed
- [ ] Sprint toggle state
- [ ] Compass/Direction
- [ ] Combo
- [ ] Config Menu
- [ ] Performance mode(decrease a bunch of settings for good performance on bad computers or laptops on battery).
- more to come(ideally, basically all of kronhud, feather, and lunar hud features unless theres some other mod that does it way better like paperdoll or I'm just dumb)

## Releases
Precompiled/built jars will likely be available once the mod gets to a decent point of functionality/development.
