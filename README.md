# AshOnDiscord HUD
HUD/UI fabric mod for 1.19.3. Will upgrade to 1.19.4/1.20 eventually. Uses https://github.com/0x3C50/Renderer as the rendering library.

## Workspace
Don't edit the serverside code(leave empty), unless you have a hud module that benefits from it and doesn't change any serverside behavior + a toggle(in game or just in the code like a boolean).

`./run/` by default only includes the mods dir(which has some basic mods that we should probably have support for aswell are just nice to have while testing). Nothing else should be included.

## Features
- [X] FPS
- [X] Keystrokes
- [ ] CPS
- [ ] Ping
- [ ] Coordinates
- more to come

## Releases
Precompiled/built jars will likely be avaiable once the mod gets to a decent point of functionality/development.
